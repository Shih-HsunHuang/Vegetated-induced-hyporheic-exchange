# Vegetated-induced-hyporheic-exchange
This program deals with the data taken from the vegetation-induced hyporheic exchange experiment conducted in Ecoflume of St. Anthony Falls Laboratory on 2021.

The experiment data can be found at: https://doi.org/10.13020/W282-JJ11

Use Get_washout_curves.m to get the washout curves from the photos.

Use Fitting_curves.m to fit the washout curves with the model and get the effective hyporheic exchange velocity V_H.
